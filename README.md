# YetAnotherCollege Font

Well, the name says all. Yet another College font. 

I designed this font in June 2015 just for fun to learn [Type 3.2](cr8software.net) from [cr8software](cr8software.net).

## License and Usage

I'd be happy if you drop me a note at martin@seventy2eleven.de if you use this font, but you don't have to.
